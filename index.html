            <div class="story-text">Nick understands what “hitting rock bottom” is all about.  An addiction to drugs had left him homeless, penniless, hopeless, and estranged from his family.  Wandering into an AA meeting in hopes of bumming a cigarette, one of the attendees made a phone call to Wayside Christian Mission.  Today, Nick has a year of sobriety under his belt and the confidence to forge a new life.  Besides learning how to live without drugs and alcohol, Nick said the program, “taught me self-confidence and brought out talents and skills that I never knew I had.”   Nick is grateful for a future that is brimming with promise.  By God’s grace and your financial support, men and women just like Nick are getting a second chance at life. </div>
